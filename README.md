- When the results state something like: `better than 7-1 (22-24 points)`,
  - this means you must have more points than that record (*in this case more than 21 points*), the accepted range is listed in parenthesis
- In Yu-Gi-Oh!, A **win** is worth `3 points`, A **draw** is worth `1 point`, and a **loss** is worth `no points`
- Breakpoints for top cut and the number of rounds are taken from the **Konami rulebook**
- The number of invites are taken from the **TheSideDeck**

### Usage: `/tournamentinfo <number_of_players>`
- `number_of_players` (**Required**): Number of players in the tournament. (*Must be a whole number 16,100...*)

### Examples:
- `/tournamentinfo <250>`
- `/tournamentinfo <5000>`

### Run time:
- `instant`

### Notes:
- The formula used for determining placements is as follows:
  - placement = (# of players / 2 ^ # of rounds) * (# of rounds) * (# of rounds - 1 / 2) ... adds on as losses increase

Example: 64 person tournament with 6 rounds
  - P0 = (64/2^6) = 1    *1 person better than 5-1*
  - P1 = (64/2^6)(6) = 6    *6 people better than 4-2*
  - P2 = (64/2^6)((6)*(5/2)) = 15
  - P3 = (64/2^6)((6)*(5/2)*(4/3)) = 20
  - P4 = (64/2^6)((6)*(5/2)*(4/3)*(3/4)) = 15
  - and so on...
